# Portfolio Project - Elist Sales Analysis

Elist is a sample e-commerce company that sells popular electronics globally. In this portfolio project, I analyzed a smaple dataset to investigate trends and growth rates in revenue, average order value (AOV), product analysis, marketing channels, and refund rates to surface insights on overall company performance. I also investigated the effectiveness of their recently launched loyalty program to give recommendations on the continuation of the program.

I used Pivot Tables, conditional formatting, aggregation functions, and statistical analysis to clean, analyzem and summarize the insights below, to be delivered to the finance and product team.

## Summary of Insights

**Yearly Trends:** From 2019 to 2022, the average annual sales reached 21K orders with a yearly sales of $5 million and an average order value of $227. Notably, 2021 had the highest number of sales (36,000), while 2020 exhibited the highest average order value ($300). 

**Seasonality:** Spring and winter months tend to have higher sales, possibly due to holiday gift-buying and promotions, and there was a spike in average sale price in January and February 2020, possibly related to pandemic purchases. 

**Products:** Apple Airpods Headphones consistently ranked as the best-selling product, and in 2022, the top three products accounted for 70% of sales, while the Bose Headphones had the lowest number of sales across most years. 

**Loyalty Program:** The team recommends continuing with the loyalty program, as these customers make more purchases on average and purchase more expensive items even with their program discount. 

## Technical Analysis
